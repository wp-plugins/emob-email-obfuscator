Version 1.0
===========
* Fixed major bug where eMob didn't play nicely with other plugins that
  automatically create a link from email addresses. Also, plays better when
  the email address is given inside an HTML tag, such as <a 
  href="mailto:...">.
  
* Automatically creates a mailto: hyperlink from the email address using a
  format that is less likely to be picked up by spambots.
  
* Total rewrite of the plugin to make it more modular and less code-wieldy.

Version 0.2
===========
* Fixed typo with HTML tag. Should be <abbr> instead of <addr>


Version 0.1
===========
* Initial version
